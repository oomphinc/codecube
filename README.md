## Why
Why another color contrast tool, you are asking? There are already [so many great tools](#alternatives) out in the wild! 

True, but, all of the tools we have found deal with only one color at a time. We wanted a tool that could assist in evaluating an entire color palette, showing us common combinations (black and white) as well as which color pairs can be used together and which to avoid. 

<!-- Additionally, we wanted this tool to adjust colors on the fly in order to achieve a passing grade. (Typically, you have to use another tool to change the color, like Photoshop or [HSLpicker.com](http://hslpicker.com/).) We allow the adjustment of the Saturation and/or the Brightness, but not the Hue. This way, the color intent is preserved but it is adjusted lighter or darker to pass a color contrast threshold. -->


## Local Setup
Very little! This project is vanilla HTML/JS and some SASS. 
1. To make HTML or JS edits, open the `index.html` in a browser and edit `assets/js/colorcube.js` in your editor of choice.
1. To compile SASS or make SCSS edits, use a local command from the project root: `$ sass --watch assets/scss:assets/css`

Need SASS? Download the latest build from [the SASS Lang page](https://sass-lang.com/install). We prefer Brew, if it matters, and version 3.7.4 minimum. 

## Offline mode
This project uses [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) (Progressive Web App) features to provide an app-like experience and to function when your device is offline.

If you are contributing to the project, you'll need to understand how to bypass this cache to see your changes and test
your work with and without a network connection to ensure offline mode continues to provide a good experience.

1. Be sure to *update the static cache version* `staticCacheName` in the service worker file (`sw.js`) to force client-side
cache invalidation
1. Add new files to the `assets` array where it makes sense so they are available offline to return visitors
